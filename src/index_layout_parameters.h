#define BLOCK_SIZE 65536

// Instead of storing the position and context for every frequency (which are sometimes in the thousands)
// Store a maximum of MAX_FREQUENCY_PROPERTIES positions/contexts for every document in a list, regardless of actual frequency
// This solves the problem of having very large chunks, that are greater than the BLOCK_SIZE, which is not allowed
// and minimizes empty space at the end of a block since chunks are small.

// The lower bound size of a single chunk in bytes (one integer per docID, frequency, and position).
// This is because all our coding methods use at least one word per integer encoded.
