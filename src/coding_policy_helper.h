// Determines size of the output buffer for decompressing to.
// Normally, this wouldn't be necessary, since if you know the uncompressed length, you wouldn't need to do an upperbound.
// However, S9 and S16 codings have a quirk that requires the output buffer array (to which we decompress) to have at least 28 empty slots;
// this is because there is a case where a word will have a max of 28 integers compressed within, and we will access the output buffer
// for all the 28 integers, even if some of those 28 integers are garbage which we haven't really compressed (but this was the case used to encode them).
// So we need to round the number of compressed integers to a multiple of 28 and make sure there is at least 28 extra space at the end of the array
// to ensure there is ample room for decompression. Here, we just use 32 instead of 28 for convenience, though it produces a slightly larger upperbound.
