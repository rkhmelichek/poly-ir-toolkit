Regarding code style, the Google C++ Style Guide
(found at http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)
should be followed. It's very practical and easy to get into; although I
explicitly did not follow the 80 character line limit; I instead doubled it to
160, which works better for wide screen monitors.
